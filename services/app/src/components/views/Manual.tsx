    title: `Blackouts`,
    entry: <div>
      <p>If you don't supply enough electricity to meet demand, you'll cause rolling blackouts that cost you customers (and thus revenue).</p>
      <p>Like utilities in real life, you aren't financially responsible for blackouts. But, if you have chronic blackouts, your board of directors might fire you!</p>

    title: `Customers, Demand & Marketing`,
    entry: <div>
      <p>More customers drives more demand. Although individual customer types (residential, commercial, industrial) have different demand curves, we've aggregated them into a single "customers" number that reflects a blend of customer types. Here's what demand by type looks like in real life:</p>
      <img src="/images/manual-demand-customer-types.png" alt="Source: https://www.eia.gov/todayinenergy/detail.php?id=10211"/>
      <p>Like in real life, you as a company can spend money on marketing to acquire more customers (you exist as one of many electricity generation companies customers can select from). Your customer base also naturally grows or shrinks depending on if you provide them good service (i.e. few blackouts).</p>
      <p>Load changes continuously as people turn stuff on and off, as temperature changes, as the natural light comes and goes, and so on. This pattern of changing load is called a "load shape". We can have daily load shapes, weekly ones, and annual ones. The following diagram shows the path of load for three different weeks at three different times of year in 2009:</p>

  {
    title: `Emissions and CO2e`,
    entry: <div>
      <p>CO2e stands for Carbon Dioxide equivalent, a measure of the greenhouse warming impact of various pollutants.</p>
      <p>Electricity generation is the 2nd largest source of greenhouse gas in the United States, but our utilities have no financial incentive to reduce their emissions.</p>
      <p>One of the highest-rated proposals to reduce emissions is a "Carbon Fee" that creates a financial incentive for businesses to reduce their carbon footprint through innovation. Electrify lets you experiment with different levels of carbon fees, and see how technology innovation can enable better business decisions than the fossil fuels of the past.</p>

    title: `Prioritizing Generators`,

      <p>Companies prioritize their generation stack based on how long they take to ramp up and down, their marginal cost (fuel) and whether they're controllable.</p>
      <p>Here's a real-world generation stack from the PJM (Pennsylvania-Jersey-Maryland) market in 2008:</p>

      <p>Scores are calculated as follows:</p>
